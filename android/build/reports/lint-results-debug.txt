/home/manuel/Documentos/Dungeon-in-Troubles/android/AndroidManifest.xml:18: Warning: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

/home/manuel/Documentos/Dungeon-in-Troubles/android/AndroidManifest.xml:9: Warning: The attribute android:fullBackupContent is deprecated from Android 12 and higher and may be removed in future versions. Consider adding the attribute android:dataExtractionRules specifying an @xml resource which configures cloud backups and device transfers on Android 12 and higher. [DataExtractionRules]
         android:fullBackupContent="true"
                                    ~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DataExtractionRules":
   Before Android 12, the attributes android:allowBackup and
   android:fullBackupContent were used to configure all forms of backup,
   including cloud backups, device-to-device transfers and adb backup.

   In Android 12 and higher, these attributes have been deprecated and will
   only apply to cloud backups. You should instead use the attribute
   android:dataExtractionRules, specifying an @xml resource that configures
   which files to back up, for cloud backups and for device-to-device
   transfers, separately. If your minSdkVersion supports older versions,
   you'll still want to specify an android:fullBackupContent resource if the
   default behavior is not right for your app.

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://material.io/design/iconography/) your launcher icons should "use a
   distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional, front view, with a slight
   perspective as if viewed from above, so that users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

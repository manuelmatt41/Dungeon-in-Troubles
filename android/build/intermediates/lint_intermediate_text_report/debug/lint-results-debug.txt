C:\Users\Manu\Documents\repositories\Dungeon-in-Troubles\android\AndroidManifest.xml:18: Warning: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

C:\Users\Manu\Documents\repositories\Dungeon-in-Troubles\android\AndroidManifest.xml:9: Warning: The attribute android:fullBackupContent is deprecated from Android 12 and higher and may be removed in future versions. Consider adding the attribute android:dataExtractionRules specifying an @xml resource which configures cloud backups and device transfers on Android 12 and higher. [DataExtractionRules]
         android:fullBackupContent="true"
                                    ~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DataExtractionRules":
   Before Android 12, the attributes android:allowBackup and
   android:fullBackupContent were used to configure all forms of backup,
   including cloud backups, device-to-device transfers and adb backup.

   In Android 12 and higher, these attributes have been deprecated and will
   only apply to cloud backups. You should instead use the attribute
   android:dataExtractionRules, specifying an @xml resource that configures
   which files to back up, for cloud backups and for device-to-device
   transfers, separately. If your minSdkVersion supports older versions,
   you'll still want to specify an android:fullBackupContent resource if the
   default behavior is not right for your app.

C:\Users\Manu\Documents\repositories\Dungeon-in-Troubles\android\res\mipmap-anydpi-v26\game_icon_round.xml:2: Warning: The resource R.mipmap.game_icon_round appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests=true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests=true.

C:\Users\Manu\Documents\repositories\Dungeon-in-Troubles\android\res\mipmap-xxxhdpi\game_icon_round.png: Warning: The following unrelated icon files have identical contents: game_icon.png, game_icon_round.png [IconDuplicates]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicates":
   If an icon is repeated under different names, you can consolidate and just
   use one of the icons and delete the others to make your application
   smaller. However, duplicated icons usually are not intentional and can
   sometimes point to icons that were accidentally overwritten or accidentally
   not updated.
